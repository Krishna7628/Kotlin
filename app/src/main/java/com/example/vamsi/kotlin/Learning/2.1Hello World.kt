/*                         Kotlin
*    Why Kotlin?
*    What are important features?
*    is Kotlin meant to replace Java future ?
*    what other type application can be build?
* ----------------->
*    Kotlin is a statical prg lang and is a JVM language
*         -> ut needs JVM( Java virtual machine) to execute its bytecode
*         -> support to avoid nullpointerexception
*         -> support immutability and Interoperability
*         -> Kotlin is a Object oriented prg
*         -> kotlin supports Functional programming lang
*              -> like lambdas, and high level functions
*              -> you can pass a function as parameter to another function
*              -> or, a function can return another function
*     Less Ceremony :
*         -> no more boilerplate code
*         -> less code, more results
*         -> code looks clean
* -------------->
* Kotlin needs jvm to jvm in runtime similar to java
*    -> kotlin compiler internally creates a class file which is loaded into memory for execution in runtime. */
